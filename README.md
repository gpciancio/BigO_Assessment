# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    Big O measures the time and space efficiency of algorithms for the worst possible scenario for example when a sorting or searching algorithm must loop through the entire data set to accomplish its goal or when conditionals are needed to run the function.

---


 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    Running Time and Space

---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    B is the correct answer

---



4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   Binary Search is the correct answer

---



5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    O(n^2) is the most efficient

---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    O(1) is the notation for accessing an element by its index with Constant Time, O(n) is the notation for finding an item in an unsorted array with Linear Time and O(n^2) is the notation for multiple sorts with Quadratic Time.

---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    Log n complexities can be recognized by splitting and filtering the data to quickly sort and access desired data
